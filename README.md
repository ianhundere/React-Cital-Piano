## React-Cital Piano

## Synopsis
A front-end web app built in React that uses the Tone.js framework to render musical sounds. The user is a given a variety of songs to play.

## Features
- 2 octave keyboard
- Keyboard controlled via mouse or QWERTY keyboard
- Each pressed key lights up to signal what is being pressed
- Metronome to assist the user in keeping time

## Successes
- The overall idea was quick to think of and we managed to untangle much of the logic necessary for executing it to MVP
- We managed to incorporate a number of things that were not initially thought up during our wireframe phase (e.g. sheet music, metronome, etc)

## Challenges
- Binding note values to QWERTY keys
- Controlling Note Off messages using the keyboard
- Tracking state for keydown presses that allows keys to light up depending on if they're pressed

## Node Dependancies
- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io)

## Future Features
- Touch capability for phones and tablets
- Record notes for playback
